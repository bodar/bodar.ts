# Research: Publishing lazyrecords package alongside totallylazy with proper version dependencies

**Date**: 2025-10-28T13:19:17+00:00
**Researcher**: Daniel Worthington-Bodart
**Git Commit**: 06b8ee5fba1fa6e5e3c372afee0bbcfe965c51af
**Branch**: master
**Repository**: bodar.ts

## Research Question
Fix issue #4: Get lazyrecords to publish to JSR alongside totallylazy, ensuring proper version dependency handling in the monorepo where lazyrecords depends on totallylazy. Investigate the publish process in the run command to understand what needs updating.

## Summary
The monorepo currently publishes `@bodar/yadic` and `@bodar/totallylazy` packages to JSR, but excludes `@bodar/lazyrecords` as noted in the comment at `run.ts:90`. The lazyrecords package uses a workspace dependency reference `"@bodar/totallylazy": "workspace:totallylazy"` in its package.json, which needs to be converted to the actual version number during publishing. The publish process generates temporary `jsr.json` files with version numbers and exports before running `bunx jsr publish`.

## Detailed Findings

### Current Publishing Process

The publishing workflow is initiated through GitHub Actions (`build.yml:22-23`) which runs `./run ci`, executing the following sequence:

1. **Build Phase** (`run.ts:46-51`):
   - Cleans artifacts and installs dependencies
   - Regenerates exports from TypeScript files
   - Runs type checking and tests

2. **Publish Phase** (`run.ts:114-122`):
   - Generates `jsr.json` configuration files
   - Executes `bunx jsr publish` with authentication
   - Cleans up temporary files

### Package Selection for Publishing

The `generateJsrJson()` function (`run.ts:87-112`) currently processes packages matching the glob pattern `packages/{yadic,totallylazy}/package.json` (line 91). This explicitly includes:
- `@bodar/yadic`
- `@bodar/totallylazy`

The exclusion of lazyrecords is documented in the comment at line 90: "lazyrecords pending totallylazy publication".

### Workspace Dependency Configuration

**Lazyrecords Dependencies** (`packages/lazyrecords/package.json:5-6`):
```json
"dependencies": {
  "@bodar/totallylazy": "workspace:totallylazy"
}
```

The `workspace:` protocol is Bun's mechanism for referencing other packages in the monorepo. During local development, this resolves to the local totallylazy package.

### Version Calculation System

The version number follows the format `0.{revisions}.{buildNumber}` (`run.ts:7-15`):
- `revisions`: Total commit count on the current branch
- `buildNumber`: GitHub Actions run number or timestamp

All packages in the monorepo receive the same version number during each publish operation.

### JSR Configuration Generation

For each package, the `generateJsrJson()` function creates a temporary `jsr.json` file containing:
- `name`: Package name from `package.json`
- `version`: Calculated version number
- `exports`: Direct copy from `package.json.exports`
- `license`: Hardcoded as `'Apache-2.0'`
- `publish.include`: Converted from `package.json.files`

### Export Regeneration

The `regenerateExports()` function (`run.ts:59-85`) automatically generates the exports mapping by:
1. Scanning for all TypeScript files in `src/` directories
2. Filtering out test files (`*.test.ts`)
3. Creating mappings like `"./file.ts": "./src/file.ts"`
4. Writing the exports back to `package.json`

### Current Package States

**Published to JSR:**
- `@bodar/yadic`: 3 exports (types.ts, LazyMap.ts, chain.ts)
- `@bodar/totallylazy`: 62 exports (predicates, parsers, transducers, functions, etc.)

**Not Published:**
- `@bodar/lazyrecords`: 25 exports (SQL builders, postgres utilities, template system)

### Environment Variables

The publish process uses:
- `JSR_TOKEN`: Authentication for non-interactive publishing (`run.ts:116`)
- `GITHUB_REF_NAME`: Branch name for version calculation
- `GITHUB_RUN_NUMBER`: Build number for version calculation

## Architecture Documentation

### Monorepo Structure
The repository uses Bun workspaces configured at the root level (`package.json:4-6`) with all packages under `packages/*`.

### Dependency Resolution
Bun's workspace protocol (`workspace:packagename`) enables local package references during development. The `bun.lock` file maintains these workspace references (`bun.lock:11-20`).

### CI/CD Pipeline
GitHub Actions runs on every push to master, executing `./run ci` which sequentially runs build and publish operations. The pipeline uses `fetch-depth: 0` to access full git history for version calculation.

### Version Synchronization
All packages receive identical version numbers during each publish cycle, ensuring consistency across the monorepo even when only individual packages change.

## Answers to Open Questions

### 1. How should the `workspace:totallylazy` dependency be converted to the actual version during JSR publishing?

**Answer**: The `workspace:totallylazy` reference in package.json should be replaced with the actual version number during the publish process. For example, `"@bodar/totallylazy": "workspace:totallylazy"` should become `"@bodar/totallylazy": "0.123.456"` where the version matches the calculated version for that build.

**Rationale**: JSR reads dependency information from package.json (as documented in the [JSR config schema](https://jsr.io/schema/config-file.v1.json)), so the workspace protocol reference must be resolved to a concrete version before publishing.

### 2. Does JSR handle workspace protocol references automatically, or does the jsr.json need to include resolved dependencies?

**Answer**: JSR does not handle workspace protocol references. Dependencies must be resolved in package.json before publishing, and jsr.json does not support a dependencies field at all.

**Rationale**: The [JSR config schema](https://jsr.io/schema/config-file.v1.json) shows that jsr.json only supports: `name`, `version`, `exports`, `license`, and `publish` fields. There is no provision for dependencies. JSR reads dependencies directly from package.json during the publish process.

### 3. Should the generated jsr.json for lazyrecords include a dependencies field with the versioned totallylazy reference?

**Answer**: No. The jsr.json should not include a dependencies field because it's not supported by the JSR config schema. Instead, the package.json file itself must be included in the published package via `publish.include`.

**Important Discovery**: Currently, package.json is NOT included in published packages. The `files` array in totallylazy's package.json (lines 68-71) only includes `"src"` and `"README.md"`. This means:
- The package.json is not being published to JSR
- Dependencies are not available in the published package
- The `publish.include` in jsr.json needs to explicitly include `"package.json"`

**Implementation Requirements**:
1. Add `"package.json"` to the `files` array in each package's package.json
2. Update the `generateJsrJson()` function to replace workspace dependencies with actual version numbers before publishing
3. The updated package.json with resolved dependencies will then be included in the published package
