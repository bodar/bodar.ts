# Increase totallylazy JSR Score to 100%

## Progress Summary

**Start:** 10/17 points (58%), 29% symbols documented
**Current:** 15/17 points (88%), 67% symbols documented
**Target:** 16-17/17 points (94-100%), 100% symbols documented

### Achievements:
- ‚úÖ Added package description (+1 point)
- ‚úÖ Added runtime compatibility (+1 point)
- ‚úÖ Added module documentation to 11 entrypoints
- ‚úÖ Documented high-priority symbols: predicates, functions, comparators (+1 point)
- ‚úÖ Documented all parser classes and utilities (+1 point)
- ‚úÖ Fixed parser examples to use correct API (view vs fromString)
- ‚úÖ Documented collection utilities
- ‚úÖ Documented grammar classes (Json, Jsdoc, C)
- ‚úÖ Fixed JSR publish to exclude test files

### Remaining Work:
- üîÑ Document remaining 33% of exported symbols to reach 100% (+1 point at 80%, potential +1 more at 100%)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Investigate "allEntrypointsDocs" criterion (added docs but JSR hasn't recognized it)

## Overview

Improve the JSR score for @bodar/totallylazy from 58% to 100% by adding missing documentation and package metadata. Following the successful approach used for @bodar/yadic (issue #2), we'll incrementally add documentation and verify improvements through CircleCI builds.

## Current State Analysis

**Current JSR Score: 58%** (based on https://jsr.io/@bodar/totallylazy/score)

### Passing Criteria (10/17 points):
- ‚úÖ Has a readme or module doc (2/2)
- ‚úÖ Has examples in the readme or module doc (1/1)
- ‚úÖ No slow types are used (5/5)
- ‚úÖ At least one runtime is marked as compatible (1/1)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Has docs for most symbols - Currently only 29% documented (1/5)

### Failing Criteria (0/7 points):
- ‚ùå Has module docs in all entrypoints (0/1)
- ‚ùå Has a description (0/1)
- ‚ùå At least two runtimes are marked as compatible (0/1)
- ‚ùå Has provenance (0/1) - requires GitHub Actions, will skip per issue #2 approach

### Key Discoveries:
- Package has 64 exported entrypoints across 8 modules (packages/totallylazy/package.json:5-69)
- Only 29% of exported symbols have documentation
- 5 modules have @module documentation (predicates, parsers, transducers, functions, comparators)
- ~34 files need JSDoc documentation
- Main missing items: module docs for collections/asserts/errors/grammars, symbol docs for most parsers/functions/comparators

## Desired End State

**Target: 94-100% JSR Score** (16-17/17 points)
- All 64 entrypoints have proper module documentation
- 100% of exported symbols documented (ensures maximum points)
- Package has a description ‚úÖ
- At least 2 runtimes marked as compatible ‚úÖ
- Provenance optional (requires GitHub Actions migration - skipping)

### Verification:
- JSR Score endpoint: `curl -s https://api.jsr.io/scopes/bodar/packages/totallylazy/score`
- JSR Score page: `curl -H 'accept: text/html' https://jsr.io/@bodar/totallylazy/score`
- CircleCI build status via MCP server after each push

## What We're NOT Doing

- Not migrating to GitHub Actions for provenance (leave for future work)
- Not changing package functionality or API
- Not modifying existing well-documented files
- Not adding documentation to test files

## Implementation Approach

Follow the incremental approach from issue #2:
1. Make one logical change per commit
2. Push and wait 30 seconds for CircleCI build
3. Check build status via CircleCI MCP server
4. Verify JSR score impact via API endpoint
5. If no impact after 2 checks, move to next item

Start with highest-impact items first (module docs, then symbol docs in order of usage).

## Phase 1: Add Package Description

### Overview
Add package description to improve searchability and score +1 point.

### Changes Required:

#### 1. Package Metadata
**File**: `packages/totallylazy/package.json`
**Changes**: Add description field after version

```json
{
  "name": "@bodar/totallylazy",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "description": "Functional programming utilities for TypeScript including lazy sequences, parsers, predicates, and transducers",
  "type": "module",
  ...
}
```

### Success Criteria:

#### Pre-commit Verification (Local):
- [x] Type checking passes: `./run check`
- [x] Tests pass: `./run test`

**Implementation Note**: After pre-commit verification passes, commit and push changes.

#### Build Verification:
- [x] CircleCI build completes: Check via `mcp__circleci-mcp-server__get_latest_pipeline_status`
- [x] Build passes: Review logs if failures occur

#### Post-deployment Verification (Production):
- [x] JSR score updated: `curl -s https://api.jsr.io/scopes/bodar/packages/totallylazy/score | jq .hasDescription`
- [x] Expected result: `true`
- [x] Score should increase to ~64% (+1 point)

---

## Phase 2: Add Runtime Compatibility

### Overview
Mark package as compatible with multiple runtimes to score +1 point.

### Changes Required:

Runtime compatibility was marked via JSR web interface.

### Success Criteria:

#### Pre-commit Verification (Local):
- [x] Determine correct configuration method - JSR web interface
- [x] Apply configuration if file-based - N/A, done via web interface

#### Post-deployment Verification (Production):
- [x] JSR score updated: `curl -s https://api.jsr.io/scopes/bodar/packages/totallylazy/score | jq .multipleRuntimesCompatible`
- [x] Expected result: `true`
- [x] Score should increase to ~70% (+1 point)

---

## Phase 3: Add Module Documentation to Missing Entrypoints

### Overview
Add @module JSDoc to entrypoints missing module-level documentation. This addresses the "Has module docs in all entrypoints" criterion (+1 point).

### Files Needing Module Documentation:

#### 1. Collections Module Entrypoints
- `packages/totallylazy/src/collections/Array.ts`
- `packages/totallylazy/src/collections/Single.ts`
- `packages/totallylazy/src/collections/Segment.ts`
- `packages/totallylazy/src/collections/ArraySegment.ts`
- `packages/totallylazy/src/collections/Sequence.ts`

#### 2. Asserts Module
- `packages/totallylazy/src/asserts/assertThat.ts`

#### 3. Errors Module
- `packages/totallylazy/src/errors/NoSuchElement.ts`

#### 4. Grammars Module
- `packages/totallylazy/src/grammars/types.ts`
- `packages/totallylazy/src/grammars/Json.ts`
- `packages/totallylazy/src/grammars/Jsdoc.ts`
- `packages/totallylazy/src/grammars/C.ts`

### Changes Required:

Read each file and add appropriate @module JSDoc documentation based on:
- Test files to understand usage
- Existing patterns from predicates/parsers/transducers/functions/comparators modules
- Actual exported functionality

**Commit strategy**: Group by module (e.g., all collections files in one commit, all grammars in another).

### Success Criteria:

#### Pre-commit Verification (Local):
- [x] Type checking passes: `./run check`
- [x] Tests pass: `./run test`
- [x] Review module docs are accurate based on tests

#### Build Verification:
- [x] CircleCI build completes successfully

#### Post-deployment Verification (Production):
- [x] JSR score updated: `curl -s https://api.jsr.io/scopes/bodar/packages/totallylazy/score | jq .allEntrypointsDocs`
- [ ] Expected result: `true` - Still shows false, may need more documentation
- [ ] Score should increase to ~76% (+1 point) - Score remains at 12/17, but percentageDocumentedSymbols increased from 0.293 to 0.303

**Note**: Module documentation was added to all identified missing entrypoints. The allEntrypointsDocs criterion may require additional work or JSR may need more time to update. Moving forward with symbol documentation which will also help.

## Phase 5: Add Symbol Documentation - Parsers

### Overview
Document parser classes and utilities. This is the largest group of undocumented files (~15 files).

### Files Needing Documentation:

#### Core Parser Classes:

**Tests to reference**:
- `test/parsers/parsers.test.ts`
- `test/parsers/Result.test.ts`
- Individual parser test files

**Commit strategy**: Group by functionality (core classes, then implementations in batches of 3-4 files).

### Success Criteria:

#### Pre-commit Verification (Local):
- [x] Type checking passes: `./run check`
- [x] Tests pass: `./run test`
- [x] Core parser classes documented (Parser, Result, AnyParser, EofParser, Failure, PredicatesParser)

#### Build Verification:
- [x] CircleCI build completes successfully

#### Post-deployment Verification (Production):
- [x] JSR score updated: `curl -s https://api.jsr.io/scopes/bodar/packages/totallylazy/score | jq .percentageDocumentedSymbols`
- [x] Percentage increased from 0.384 to 0.539 (~54%)
- [x] Score increased to 14/17 (82%) - gained 1 point from crossing 50% documentation threshold
- [ ] Still need to reach 0.80 (80%) threshold for maximum points

---

## Phase 6: Add Symbol Documentation - Collections & Remaining

### Overview
Document all remaining exported symbols to reach 100% symbol documentation. This ensures we get the maximum points possible and provide comprehensive API documentation for users.

**Current Status: 15/17 points (88%), 67.00% symbols documented**

**Progress in Phase 6:**
- Batch 1 (commit 8694375): 54% ‚Üí 58% (+4%)
- Batch 2 (commit 7af2822): 58% ‚Üí 66% (+8%, gained +1 point to 15/17)
- Batch 3 (commit e0521ad): 66% ‚Üí 67% (+1%)
- JSR publish fix (commit 68cf67e): Fixed test files being published to JSR

### Completed in Phase 6:

**Batch 1** (commit 8694375) - 54% ‚Üí 58.25%:
- [x] `packages/totallylazy/src/collections/Sequence.ts` - Added JSDoc to iterate() and repeat() functions (from earlier work)
- [x] `packages/totallylazy/src/collections/Single.ts` - Added JSDoc to single() function (from earlier work)
- [x] Fixed all parser examples to use view() instead of fromString() (from earlier work)
- [x] Documented transducer type guards: isMapTransducer, isFilterTransducer, isFlatMapTransducer
- [x] Documented Transducer.transducer() factory function
- [x] Documented ArraySegment.fromArray() and fromString()
- [x] Documented Sequence.sequence() overloads with comprehensive example
- [x] Documented lazy.ts exports (lazy function with object example, GetterPropertyDescriptor interface, internal helpers)
- [x] Documented Jsdoc.ts exports (JsdocTags interface, JsdocComment class)
- [x] Documented C.ts Comment class

**Batch 2** (commit 7af2822) - 58% ‚Üí 66%, +1 point to 15/17:
- [x] Documented 18 parser combinators in parsers.ts:
  - then, next, followedBy, notFollowedBy, precededBy
  - between, surroundedBy, separatedBy
  - returns, ignore, literal, debug
  - whitespace, among
  - many, many1, atLeast, atMost
- [x] Documented assertion functions in assertThat.ts:
  - assertThat (predicate-based validation)
  - assertTrue and assertFalse (type assertions)
- [x] Documented PredicatesParser.matches() function

**Batch 3** (commit e0521ad) - 66% ‚Üí 67%:
- [x] Documented Json class and 10 static members (null, boolean, escaped, characters, string, number, whitespace, value, custom)
- [x] Documented Jsdoc class and 4 static members (typeExpression, type, tags, jsdoc)
- [x] Documented C class and 3 static members (singleLineComment, multiLineComment, comment)
- [x] Documented DebugParser class
- [x] Documented Segment.toString() function

### Files Already Documented:
- ‚úÖ CompositeTransducer.ts - Already has full documentation
- ‚úÖ All parser files - Fully documented in Phase 5
- ‚úÖ Core predicates, functions, comparators - Fully documented in Phase 4
- ‚úÖ Module documentation for all identified entrypoints - Phase 3

### New Goal: 100% Symbol Documentation

**Rationale for 100% target:**
- Ensures we exceed the 80% threshold for maximum JSR points
- Provides complete API documentation for all users
- Eliminates guesswork about which symbols still need docs
- Sets high quality standard for the package

**Remaining work:** Document the remaining **33% of exported symbols** (from 67% to 100%)

**Batch 4** (commit pending) - 67% ‚Üí target 100%:
- [x] Identified all 15 undocumented exported symbols across 7 files using systematic analysis
- [x] Documented Array.ts types: ArrayContains, ReadonlyArrayContains, toPromiseArray
- [x] Documented Segment.ts classes: EmptySegment, ASegment, empty constant, segment function
- [x] Documented type guards: isProperty (Property.ts), isSelect (Select.ts)
- [x] Documented grammar types: JsonArray, JsonObject, JsonValue (grammars/types.ts)
- [x] Verified CompositeTransducer.ts already has full documentation (isCompositeTransducer, flatten)
- [x] Pre-commit verification passed (type check and tests)

**Strategy for Batch 4:**
- Use JSR API or systematic grep to identify ALL undocumented exported symbols
- Document them systematically by module
- Use concise single-line JSDoc comments (consistent with Batch 3 approach)
- Commit in logical batches to track progress

### Success Criteria:

#### Pre-commit Verification (Local):
- [x] Type checking passes: `./run check`
- [x] Tests pass: `./run test`

#### Build Verification:
- [x] CircleCI build completes successfully (multiple commits)

#### Post-deployment Verification (Production):
- [x] JSR score at 15/17 (88%), symbol documentation at 67.00%
- [ ] Reach 80% symbol documentation (+1 point to 16/17)
- [ ] Reach 100% symbol documentation (ensures maximum documentation quality)
- [ ] Final target: 94-100% score (16-17/17 points)
  - In Progress: +1 point for 80% symbol documentation (currently at 67%, need 13% more to reach 80%)
  - Goal: 100% symbol documentation (33% remaining)
  - Remaining: 1 point for "allEntrypointsDocs" (still false - needs investigation)
  - Skipping: 1 point for provenance (requires GitHub Actions migration)

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests:
- All existing tests must continue to pass
- No new tests required (documentation-only changes)
- Use tests to understand functionality for accurate documentation

### Local Verification (Pre-commit):
1. Type check: `./run check`
2. Run tests: `./run test`
3. Review JSDoc syntax is correct

### Build Verification (After commit/push):
1. Wait 30 seconds for CircleCI to start
2. Check build status: Use CircleCI MCP server `get_latest_pipeline_status`
3. Review build logs if failures occur
4. Fix issues and commit again if needed

### Production Verification (After build succeeds):
1. Check score API: `curl -s https://api.jsr.io/scopes/bodar/packages/totallylazy/score`
2. Check score page: `curl -H 'accept: text/html' https://jsr.io/@bodar/totallylazy/score`
3. Verify specific criteria changed (e.g., `hasDescription`, `percentageDocumentedSymbols`)
4. If no change after 2 verification cycles, move to next phase

## Performance Considerations

- Documentation changes have no runtime performance impact
- Build times may increase slightly with more JSDoc parsing
- JSR score updates may take 30-60 seconds after successful publish

## Migration Notes

Not applicable - documentation-only changes, no breaking changes to API.
